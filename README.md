## Hi, my name is Rio ðŸ‘‹

<img src="banner.png">
I was raised in Peru and NYC, and I'm currently living in Pittsburgh, PA. I believe that tech and art teach us about the vastness of creation and my intent as a software engineer is to deliver powerful, creative products that can shift narratives and foster real connection. 
<p></p>
As someone who was raised in the country and outside of it, I saw the ways that the phone and internet could travel across time and lands. As someone who has had parents incarcerated at a young age, I understood the power that technology could hold over keeping a family together. I want to dig my feet into the infinite possibilities of what tech could do for people, because it's done so much for me. Even when I didn't know it. 
<p></p>
Whether it's providing real human connection, or figuring out how users can best relate to a product, Iâ€™m a determined software engineer, detail-oriented artist, and an asset to any team I am a part of.
