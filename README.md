## Hi, my name is Rio ðŸ‘‹

<img src="newbanner.png">
I'm a software engineer with a focu on the intersection of creativity and software. I believe that tech and art teach us about the vastness of creation and my intent as a software engineer is to deliver powerful, helpful products that can shift narratives and fuel connection. 
<p></p>
As someone who grew up in a transnational family, I saw the ways that the phone and internet could travel across time and lands. As someone who has had parents incarcerated at a young age, I understood the power that technology could hold over keeping a family together. I want to dig my feet into the infinite possibilities of what tech could do for people, because it's done so much for me. Even when I didn't know it. 
<p></p>
Whether it's providing figuring out how users can best relate to a product or figuring out how a product can best relate to a user, Iâ€™m a determined engineer, detail-oriented artist, and an asset to any team I am a part of.
